# String Puzzles
#### Respond to the following:

1. *In your own words*, discuss what each String method does:
  * `.substring(a)`
    * It will extract a part of a String from index a to the end of the String.

  * `.substring(a, b)`
    * It will extract a part of a String from index a to but not including index b.

  * `.indexOf(str)`
    * It will return a number, representing the index of str when it first occurs. However if str is not found in the String it will return a number of -1.

  * `.equals(str)`
    * It checks whether if the String inside the parentheses is equal to the String being held in the variable.


2. *In your own words*, discuss what the following `for` loop accomplishes for `String s`:
```
for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
      // DO STUFF
}
```
  * This for loop will loop over and over again as long as the number of times it loops around is less than the length of String s. During each loop it will accomplish whatever is inside the for loop until the condition is proven false.
